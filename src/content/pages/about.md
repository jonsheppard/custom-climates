    bio: "Travis spent 19 years in the oil and gas trenches with Exxon Mobil and BP, where small miscalculations cost millions. His last eight years as Book Lead for BP's Crude Oil Trading group taught him how to manage risk when the stakes are high and the weather doesn't care about your timeline.<br/><br/>He was part of the BP Crude Oil Executive Team running one of the world's largest trading operations. Think logistics nightmares, commodity price swings, and keeping product flowing across North America no matter what the elements threw at them.<br/><br/>After retiring in 2020, Travis turned his attention to helping startups solve real problems. At Custom Climates, he brings that same risk management mindset to keeping your materials safe and your projects on track."
