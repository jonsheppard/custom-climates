# 📄 Custom Climates Website Copy Strategy

> **Goal:** Communicate what Custom Climates does, why it matters, and how to engage—quickly, clearly, and persuasively.

---

## 🔥 Core Messaging Pillars

### 1. Problem-Focused Value Proposition (Above the Fold)
Hook site visitors with pain-relief messaging:
- Speak to *time*, *money*, and *quality* pressures contractors face
- Reinforce what makes Custom Climates different (onsite, plug-n-play, controlled environment, real-time monitoring)

**Hero Example:**
> “Don’t Let Weather Ruin Your Schedule.  
> Protect Every Panel, Plank, and Pallet with Mobile Climate-Controlled Storage.”

---

### 2. Trust Through Specifics
Make the invisible visible—contractors need to *see* how it works:
- Breakdown of the product: trailers/containers, power options, monitoring tools
- Quick stats like “$2.5B in jobsite weather damage annually”
- Logos of clients, testimonials, or field photos if available

---

## 🧭 Site Map & Copy Strategy

### Homepage
**Goal:** Introduce what Custom Climates does, show the product at a glance, and get users to request a quote

**Sections:**
- Hero (with benefit-driven headline and CTA)

- Trust Signals (data, reviews, badges)
- CTA with urgency (e.g., “Get My Custom Quote”)

---

### Our Process Page
**Goal:** Build confidence in the simplicity and reliability of the service

**Structure:**

- Add optional paths: rent vs buy, trailer vs container
- Emphasize support: real humans, responsive service
- End with CTA to book a call or fill out quote form

### Our Equipment Page
**Goal:** Showcase technical credibility and options for pros who need specs

**Structure:**

- For each: sizes, power source (generator + shore), features like humidifiers, sensors, insulation, camera
- Add downloadable spec sheets or PDF cut sheets
- Include photos or videos of equipment in action
